## Project goals

### Background
As a professional withn the survey industry (land surveying),I come across very many different formats in a weekly basis. Some of them are different file formats, some of them are basic text. Problem is there is hundrets of different formating used on basic text or spreadsheet documents. I want to make an app that cleans up a text file, and make the spreadsheet ready for me to use in a software.

### Goals

- Manipulatin the existing spreadsheet
- Interact with the user via terminal

## User Experience

- The app should explain the process to the user in the terminal
- User interaction should be self explanatory
